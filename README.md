This visualization illustrates how much monthly rainfall has deviated from the long term average across districts in India. The long term average is defined as the average rainfall between 1900 and 1930, by month and by district.

Rainfall within one standard deviation of the long term average is considered normal. In each direction, the color scale spans three deviations away from the mean. Gray indicates data is not available.
